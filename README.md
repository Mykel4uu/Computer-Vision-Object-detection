# Object Detection
Object detection is the task of identifying and locating objects in an image or video. Object detection algorithms typically work by first dividing the image into a grid of cells. Then, they use a classifier to predict the probability of each cell containing an object. Finally, they use a bounding box regressor to predict the coordinates of the object's bounding box.
# Yolov8
Yolov5 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is known for its speed and accuracy. Yolov8 is a single-stage algorithm, which means that it predicts the bounding boxes and classes of objects in a single pass. Yolov8 is also very efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.
# Deep Sort
Deep Sort is a state-of-the-art object tracking algorithm that is known for its accuracy and robustness. Deep Sort uses a Kalman filter to track the objects detected by Yolov8. The Kalman filter is a recursive filter that is used to estimate the state of a system over time. Deep Sort also uses a nearest neighbor algorithm to associate the tracked objects with the objects detected in the previous frame.
# The project
I used Deep sort as the tracking algorithm and Yolo as the object tracking algorithm, which is aimed at detecting and tracking people in this project.
